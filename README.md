Progress Story:

Day 1: I didn't get to do much beside making the Trello board, testing the then API, also working on the wire frame of the app. I was able to get started on working on the sign-in feature using passport and salt/dash. Although getting a head start I wasn't able to go far as I was stucked with an unfamiliar error the Body Parser.

Day 2: I figured out how to go thru the error as I talk thru the issue with a couple classmates who had the same issues that I did. As I went thru the passport (sign in, sign up), I started to approach the mechanism of the app, which including making request to API thru front end or back end, structure and flow of the app. I successfully figured out the front end making request to API by the end of the day. 

Day 3: I stalled throughout most of this day as I was trying to learn the MVC layout and making effective AJAX call, making Express call on the back end and pulling EJS component to the front end. 

Day 4: I made most of my progress this day as I finally grabbed the concept of the flow in an app, the structure starting to make sense for me and I was able to finish up 80% of what I intended to do for this project. I struggle a gain this day as I was trying to make the portfolio of the user to automatically make a request to the API to grab the crucial up to date information on the index which is triggered by the click "search for another index". I learned Promises...one hell of a tool but hard to understand.

Day 5: Presentation day
